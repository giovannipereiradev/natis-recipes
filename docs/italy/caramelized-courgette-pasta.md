    **Preparation time:** 50 minutes (includes draining time)  
    **Yield:** 2 servings (200g each)  

## Preparation Method

1. **Prep zucchini:** Grate zucchini using the large holes of a cheese grater. Place in a cloth with a pinch of salt, mix, then set the cloth inside a bowl for 30 minutes.  
2. **Drain liquid:** After resting, squeeze zucchini firmly to remove excess water, collecting the green juice in the bowl. Reserve juice for later.  
3. **Cook zucchini:** Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add zucchini and fry, stirring occasionally, until golden brown (about 5–8 minutes). If too dry, add a splash of pasta water.  
4. **Cook pasta:** Boil pasta in salted water until al dente. Drain, reserving some pasta water.  
5. **Combine:** Add pasta to skillet with zucchini. Pour in ~60 ml (¼ cup) reserved zucchini juice and a splash of pasta water. Toss until a sauce forms.  
6. **Finish:** Add zest of ½ lemon, chopped basil, and juice of ½ lemon. Toss well. Stir in butter until melted. Adjust salt or lemon to taste.  
7. **Serve:** Plate immediately, garnished with extra basil if desired.
