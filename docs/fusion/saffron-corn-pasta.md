## Preparation Method

1. **Prep saffron:** Place saffron threads in a small bowl with an ice cube. Let melt fully to create saffron water.  
2. **Cook vegetables:** Heat 3 tbsp butter in a skillet over medium-low. Add onion and garlic, sauté 5–6 minutes until softened. Add corn kernels and saffron water, sauté 3–4 minutes until corn is bright yellow. Season with salt.  
3. **Cook pasta:** Boil pasta in salted water until al dente. Reserve ¾ cup pasta water. Drain and return pasta to pot.  
4. **Make sauce:** Blend sautéed corn mixture with ½ cup pasta water, almond milk, and miso until smooth. Adjust salt to taste. Toss sauce with pasta over medium heat, adding more pasta water to emulsify.  
5. **Toast breadcrumbs:** In a pan, melt 2 tbsp butter. Add panko and toast until golden. Stir in harissa seasoning, then remove from heat and toss with parsley.  
6. **Serve:** Plate pasta, sprinkle with harissa breadcrumbs, and finish with cracked black pepper.
