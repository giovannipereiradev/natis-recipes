## Preparation Method

1. Peel the potatoes and dice them into bite-sized chunks.  
2. In the meantime, blend the ginger, garlic, and canned tomatoes until smooth.  
3. Heat a pan with a generous splash of oil and add the cumin seeds. When they begin to sizzle, stir in the blended tomato mixture.  
4. Stir in the chilli powder, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and salt, mixing thoroughly to combine.

6. Stir in the peas, then gently mash some of the potatoes against the side of the pan to help thicken the curry. Let it cook for an additional 5 minutes.  
7. Finish by garnishing with chopped coriander and serve.
