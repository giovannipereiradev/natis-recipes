## Preparation Method

1. Cook quinoa according to package instructions.  
2. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with foil.  
3. Slice the tops off acorn squash (and a thin slice off the bottoms so they stand upright). Scoop out and discard seeds. Place hollow squash on the baking sheet.  
4. Dice onion and bacon. Heat a little butter in a skillet, add onion and bacon, and cook until bacon is browned and onion turns translucent. Add kale and cook until wilted.  
5. In a mixing bowl, combine quinoa, bacon, onion, and kale. Stir to fully incorporate.  
6. Add a dab of butter inside each squash cavity. Stuff with filling and place a small pat of butter on top of each.  
7. Bake for about 45 minutes, until squash flesh is tender and easily pierced with a fork.  
8. Serve warm, optionally with yogurt sauce.
