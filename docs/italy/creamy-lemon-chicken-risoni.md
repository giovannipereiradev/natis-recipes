## Preparation Method

1. **Marinate chicken:** In a shallow dish, combine chicken with garlic, oregano, paprika, onion powder, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Mix until evenly coated.  
2. **Cook chicken:** Heat a large frying pan over medium–high heat. Cook chicken for 4–5 minutes on each side until just cooked. Add butter and lemon slices in the last 2 minutes to caramelize. Remove chicken and lemons; set aside.  
3. **Cook risoni:** In the same pan, add risoni, chicken stock, cream, lemon juice, and mustard. Stir and bring to a simmer.  
4. Reduce heat to medium–low and cook uncovered for 10–12 minutes, stirring regularly, until risoni is tender.  
5. Remove from heat. Stir in spinach and parmesan. Season with pepper and salt. Cover and let sit for 2–3 minutes.  
6. **Serve:** Top the risoni with sliced chicken and caramelized lemon slices. Garnish with lemon balm or parsley if desired.
