## Preparation Method

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).  
2. Rub the crushed garlic and seasoning into the fish. Place in a baking tray, smear with 3 tbsp olive oil, and let rest for 15 minutes.  
3. Bake the fish for 10 minutes per inch of thickness, about 40–50 minutes for a whole fish.  
4. Meanwhile, place sliced eggplants in a strainer, sprinkle with salt, and let rest for 20 minutes. Rinse and pat dry with kitchen paper.  
5. Heat the remaining olive oil in a skillet to about 1 inch depth. Fry eggplant slices in batches until golden on both sides. Drain on paper towels.  
6. In a saucepan, bring pomegranate juice to a boil and reduce to about 1½ cups. Stir in basil, minced garlic, cilantro (or celery leaves), onion, and seasoning. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.  
7. Arrange the baked fish on a platter, surround with fried eggplant slices, and serve with the pomegranate sauce in a bowl on the side.
