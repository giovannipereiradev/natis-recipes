## Preparation Method

1. Thinly slice onion and mince garlic. Bring cream (or coconut milk) to room temperature.  
2. Heat butter and olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions and cook 15–20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until caramelized. Add a splash of water if they stick.  
3. Meanwhile, cook pasta in salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain.  
4. Once onions are golden, stir in garlic and seasonings. Cook 1 minute, then add chili crisp and sauté briefly. Stir in cream (or coconut milk) and simmer a few minutes. Mix in Parmesan until melted.  
5. Add pasta to skillet, tossing to coat. Use reserved pasta water to adjust consistency to silky.  
6. Serve hot, topped with extra chili crisp and fresh parsley if desired.
