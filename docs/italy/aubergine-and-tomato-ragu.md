## Preparation Method

1. Preheat the oven to 170°C.  
2. Blend the tomatoes, shallots, garlic, red chili, and olive oil together.  
3. Spread the mixture across 2 to 3 baking trays and roast for 1 hour and 30 minutes, or until it thickens and caramelizes.  
4. Roast the aubergines directly on a gas flame for 15 minutes, until they’re deeply charred and soft inside. Once done, wash off the charred skin and chop the flesh into a minced texture.  
5. Cook the pappardelle in a large pot of boiling, heavily salted water.  
6. Once the tomatoes are roasted, transfer them to a pan with the aubergine, 200ml of pasta water, basil, and cream cheese. Bring to a simmer, then add the cooked pasta. Toss everything together and season with salt and pepper to taste.  
7. Top with parmesan and enjoy!
