## Preparation Method

1. Sauté the leeks and garlic in butter for about 3 minutes, or until softened.  
2. Stir in the spinach, basil, 100ml of chicken stock, and ½ teaspoon of salt.  
3. Let the spinach cook down, then blend it with the remaining chicken stock using a hand blender until smooth.  
4. Stir in the orzo and cook over medium heat for 6 minutes, until it’s nearly cooked through.  
5. Add the asparagus and peas to the pot, stirring well, and continue cooking for another 3 minutes, or until the vegetables and orzo are fully cooked. Meanwhile, place the pancetta in a cold pan and set it over medium-high heat. Cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the fat to render and the pancetta to become crispy.  
6. Transfer the pancetta to a plate, then add the chilli flakes and mushrooms to the pan. Cook the mushrooms for 5 minutes, or until they turn crispy.  
7. Serve topped with an egg yolk, crispy pancetta, mushrooms, and a sprinkle of Parmesan.
