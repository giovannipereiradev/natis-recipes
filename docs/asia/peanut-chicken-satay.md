## Preparation Method

1. In a mixing bowl, combine chicken pieces with marinade ingredients and ¼ cup coconut milk. Mix well and marinate for at least 20 minutes (or overnight for best flavor).  
2. Thread chicken pieces onto skewers, about 4–5 pieces each.  
3. Heat 1½ tbsp oil in a large non-stick skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Cook skewers in batches for about 3 minutes per side, until golden and cooked through.  
4. For the peanut sauce: place remaining coconut milk and all peanut sauce ingredients in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir until combined, then simmer gently for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust with water for a thick but pourable consistency. Keep warm.  
5. For serving: pour some peanut sauce into a small bowl and sprinkle with chopped peanuts. Arrange skewers on a platter, sprinkle with remaining peanuts, coriander, and chili. Serve with sauce for dipping, and optionally with jasmine rice or Thai fried rice.
