## Preparation Method

1. **Prep:** Marinate the pork with ¼ cup teriyaki sauce for 2–3 hours or up to a full day.  
2. **Rice:** Combine coconut milk, water, and jasmine rice in an Instant Pot. Cook on high pressure for 3 minutes, then let naturally release for 10–15 minutes. Fluff with a fork and season with a little salt.
