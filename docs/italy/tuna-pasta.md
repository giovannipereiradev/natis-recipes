## Preparation Method

1. Bring 3 liters / 3 quarts of water to a boil with 1 tablespoon of salt. Cook the pasta according to package directions, minus 1 minute. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water, then drain.  
2. In the same pot, heat the reserved tuna oil over medium heat. Add garlic, anchovies, and chili flakes. Sauté for 1 minute.  
3. Return pasta to the pot with capers and ⅓ cup reserved pasta water. Toss with two spatulas for 2 minutes.  
4. Turn off the heat. Add tuna, parsley, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Toss gently to combine, leaving some tuna chunks intact.  
5. Serve immediately.
