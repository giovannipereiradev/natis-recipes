## Preparation Method

1. **Prep shallots:** Slice thinly and place in a shallow pan with olive oil. Fry over low-medium heat until light golden. Strain, reserving oil. Transfer shallots to paper towels, season with salt, and let crisp.  
2. **Make dressing:** Blend basil, garlic, lemon juice (and zest), olive oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper until smooth. Reserve.  
3. **Blanch peas:** Boil water, salt generously, and blanch snap peas for 45 seconds. Transfer to an ice bath, then slice thin on the diagonal.  
4. **Prep components:** Dice strawberries and grate parmesan.  
5. **Cook pasta:** Boil orzo until al dente. Drain and toss with reserved shallot oil to prevent sticking.  
6. **Assemble salad:** In a large bowl, combine orzo, strawberries, snap peas, fried shallots, parmesan, and basil dressing. Toss well.  
7. **Serve:** Adjust seasoning if needed. Chill in fridge until ready to enjoy.
