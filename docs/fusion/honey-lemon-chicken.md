## Preparation Method

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).  
2. Season the chicken breasts and the flour with salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and oregano (if using).  
3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil.  
4. Lightly coat the chicken in the seasoned flour, shaking off excess. Brown the chicken on each side in the hot skillet, adding 1 tablespoon of butter. Do not fully cook; just sear for color.  
5. Transfer the browned chicken to an oven-safe dish. In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, chicken stock, and honey. Simmer briefly, then pour over the chicken. Squeeze the juice of 1–2 lemons on top.  
6. Slice the third lemon into thin rounds (removing seeds) and arrange over the chicken. Add red pepper flakes if desired.  
7. Bake for 25–30 minutes, until chicken is golden, sauce has thickened, and lemons are softened and caramelized.  
8. Top with fresh parsley and serve with rice.
