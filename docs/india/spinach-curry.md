## Preparation Method

1. Slice the garlic thinly.  
2. Puree the tinned tomatoes and ginger until smooth.  
3. Heat 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a pan and add the cumin seeds. Once they begin to sizzle, stir in the garlic.  
4. Cook the garlic for a few minutes until it turns slightly golden, then pour in the blended tomatoes. Rinse the blender with 100ml of water and add it to the pan as well.  
5. Stir in the chili powder, ground coriander, ground cumin, ground turmeric, and salt.  
6. Cook for 5 minutes, or if you have more time, let it cook for 15 minutes until the oil separates.  
7. Add the bag of baby spinach, cover with a lid, and let it wilt for a few minutes.  
8. Stir the spinach thoroughly until it's completely cooked through, then sprinkle in the chopped coriander.  
9. Serve hot with rice or rotli.
