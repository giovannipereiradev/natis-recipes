## Preparation Method

1. **Cook leek:** Heat the butter and olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the leek, garlic, chilli flakes and a pinch of salt. Cook with the lid on, stirring occasionally, for 12–15 minutes until soft and slightly golden.  
2. **Combine:** Stir in the miso paste and pasta, toasting for 1–2 minutes. Add the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Cook with the lid off until the pasta is al dente, adding a little more water if it reduces too quickly. Stir in the lemon juice. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper or more lemon.  
3. **Serve:** Divide the pasta between bowls. Sprinkle over the lemon zest and extra chilli flakes. Serve hot.  
4. **Suggestion:** Stir through a can of chickpeas for added protein and texture.
