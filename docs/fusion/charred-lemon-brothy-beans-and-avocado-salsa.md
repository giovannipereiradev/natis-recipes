## Preparation Method

1. Rinse beans and remove debris. Soak overnight in water (about 3 inches above beans).  
2. Heat 1 tbsp avocado oil in a large pot over medium-low. Place lemon and onions cut-side down, cook 3 minutes. Add garlic cut-side down, cook another 3 minutes until slightly charred. Remove lemon, reserve.  
3. Add remaining 1 tbsp oil and red pepper flakes, cook 1 minute. Drain beans and add them with rosemary, thyme, bay leaves, and 8 cups water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer.  
4. Partially cover and cook 30 minutes. Add salt, stir, and cook 1–1 ½ hrs more, checking every 30 minutes and adding water as needed to keep beans submerged.  
5. Test beans for doneness. Squeeze roasted garlic into pot, add lemon juice, discard skins and solids (lemon, onions, herbs).  
6. Whisk miso paste with a ladle of broth, then stir back into the pot. Adjust salt to taste.  
7. **Prepare salsa:** Combine avocado, scallions, parsley, jalapeño, lemon zest and juice, and a pinch of salt. Mix well.  
8. Serve beans in bowls with broth, topped with avocado salsa, cracked pepper, and toasted sourdough.
