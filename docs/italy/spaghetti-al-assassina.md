## Preparation Method

1. **Prepare tomato broth:** Heat olive oil in a pot over medium. Add garlic and cook ~1 minute until golden and fragrant. Stir in tomato purée, water, and salt. Bring to a simmer, then reduce to low to keep warm.  
2. **Cook spaghetti:** In a non-stick skillet, heat ¼ cup olive oil over medium-high. Add chili flakes and sizzle for 1 minute. Add raw spaghetti and toss until coated.  
3. **First broth addition:** Pour in ~3 cups of tomato broth. Using tongs, move pasta side to side until most broth is absorbed and spaghetti begins frying.  
4. **Char pasta:** Flip spaghetti, arrange evenly, and cook until browned and lightly charred.  
5. **Second broth addition:** Add ~2 more cups of broth. Continue cooking, moving spaghetti, until pasta reaches desired char and doneness. Add more broth at the end if you prefer it saucier.  
6. **Serve:** Garnish with parsley, extra chili flakes, and a drizzle of olive oil. Serve hot.
