## Preparation Method

1. Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add pancetta and cook for ~6 minutes until golden brown. Remove pancetta with a slotted spoon and set aside.  
2. In the same pan, sauté onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes for ~6 minutes until softened and slightly golden. Adjust heat if garlic cooks too quickly.  
3. Add chardonnay and cook for 2 minutes to reduce.  
4. Return pancetta and juices to the pan, stirring to combine.  
5. Stir in crushed tomatoes, bay leaf, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook for 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.  
6. Meanwhile, cook bucatini in salted boiling water until al dente (about 9 minutes). Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain.  
7. Add pasta to the sauce and toss to coat. Stir in ½ cup reserved pasta water and cook over medium heat for a few more minutes until the sauce thickens and coats the noodles.  
8. Serve topped generously with Romano cheese, fresh parsley, and extra black pepper.
