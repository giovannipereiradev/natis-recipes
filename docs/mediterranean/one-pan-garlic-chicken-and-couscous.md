## Preparation Method

1. **Prep chicken:** Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Season generously with salt and pepper.  
2. **Sear chicken:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over medium. Place chicken skin-side down, cook 6–8 minutes until skin is crisp and golden. Flip and cook 4–5 minutes. Transfer to a plate.  
3. **Cook couscous base:** Add remaining 2 tbsp oil to pan with shallots. Cook 2 minutes. Stir in couscous and cook 4–5 minutes until toasty. Add water, garlic, bouillon, and a pinch of salt. Place chicken thighs on top, skin-side up. Bring to a simmer, then remove from heat.  
4. **Bake:** Cover tightly with foil and bake 30–35 minutes until most liquid is absorbed.  
5. **Prepare dill topping:** Mix dill, capers, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, chili flakes, salt, and pepper in a bowl.  
6. **Finish chicken:** Remove foil and bake 5 minutes more. Preheat broiler and crisp chicken skin under broiler for 2–3 minutes.  
7. **Serve:** Mash softened garlic cloves over chicken. Spoon dill topping across chicken and couscous. Serve immediately.
