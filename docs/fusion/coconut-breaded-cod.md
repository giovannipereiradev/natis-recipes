## Preparation Method

1. In a food processor, pulse the cumin seeds, ground coriander, and sourdough breadcrumbs until fine.  
2. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add breadcrumbs, season with ½ tsp salt, and cook 3–4 minutes. Stir in shredded coconut and cook 2–3 minutes until golden. Transfer to a bowl and wipe out the skillet.  
3. To the skillet, add coconut milk, rinsed rice, and water. Stir, bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low. Cover and cook 20–30 minutes until creamy.  
4. In a blender, combine cilantro, jalapeños (seeds removed), garlic, and lemon juice. Blend into a chunky green sauce, thinning with water if necessary. Season with salt.  
5. Portion the cod into 4 pieces, seasoning both sides with salt and pepper.  
6. When the rice thickens, stir in half the green sauce. Nestle cod pieces on top of the rice, cover, and steam 10–12 minutes until opaque.  
7. Stir the remaining green sauce into the rice. Scatter toasted breadcrumbs over the cod.  
8. Garnish with extra cilantro and serve with lemon wedges.
