    **Preparation time:** 1 hour 30 minutes (includes marinating)

## Preparation Method

1. **Marinate chicken:** Whisk marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Add chicken, coat well, cover, and refrigerate 30 minutes to 2 hours (max 4).  
2. **Boil potatoes:** Place scored potatoes in a pot with salted cold water (1 inch above potatoes). Boil 20–30 minutes until fork-tender.  
3. **Preheat oven:** Set to 350°F (175°C). Remove chicken from fridge and bring closer to room temp.  
4. **Roast carrots:** Toss carrots with olive oil, honey, balsamic, salt, pepper, and zest. Arrange on baking dish.  
5. **Bake chicken + carrots:** Place chicken and carrots in oven. Bake 35–45 minutes, until chicken reaches 160°F (70°C). Check carrots at 35 min and remove if ready.  
6. **Infuse milk:** While baking, warm milk and butter with garlic and thyme. Simmer gently, then strain.  
7. **Mash potatoes:** Drain and peel boiled potatoes. Mash or rice them, folding in infused milk and butter gradually. Stir in goat cheese until creamy. Season to taste.  
8. **Make glaze:** In a small pan, simmer balsamic, honey, orange juice, salt, and pepper for 2–3 minutes until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and whisk in butter until glossy.  
9. **Assemble:** Plate mashed potatoes, top with chicken thighs, drizzle glaze, and serve with roasted carrots on the side.
