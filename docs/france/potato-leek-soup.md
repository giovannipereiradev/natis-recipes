## Preparation Method

1. Melt butter over medium heat in a large soup pot. Add leeks and garlic, cooking for about 10 minutes until soft and wilted, stirring regularly. Do not brown.  
2. Add potatoes, broth, bay leaves, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to low heat. Simmer for 15 minutes, until potatoes are very soft.  
3. Remove thyme sprigs and bay leaves. Purée soup with an immersion blender until smooth. (If using a standard blender, purée in batches; do not overfill.)  
4. Stir in heavy cream and bring back to a simmer. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. If too thin, simmer to thicken; if too thick, add water or broth.  
5. Garnish with fresh chives before serving.  

**Freezer Tip:** Soup can be frozen (without cream) for up to 3 months. Defrost in the fridge, reheat, then add cream before serving.
