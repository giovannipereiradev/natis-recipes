## Preparation Method

1. Wash and prepare the brussel sprouts and potatoes. Place the potatoes in a pot with cold water, bring to a boil, and cook for 25–30 minutes until tender.

3. Smash the sprouts and potatoes with the bottom of a cup (lined with baking paper) on a tray. Season with olive oil, salt, dried herbs, garlic + onion powder, paprika, and white pepper. Roast at 200°C (400°F) until crispy.  
4. In a mixing bowl, prepare the dressing by combining vegan mayo, vegan yogurt, lemon juice, parsley, and chives.  
5. Add the roasted vegetables to the bowl, toss to coat, and garnish with crispy onions.  
6. Serve warm or at room temperature.
